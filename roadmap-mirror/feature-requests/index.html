However when i try to start High Fidelity, it starts SteamVR aswell even though i wish to be in Desktop mode. So my option stands that i always have to unplug my HTC Vive everytime i wish to be in Desktop mode and replug it when i want to be in VR mode. 

There should be an option at the start of High Fidelity, to start in VR or Desktop mode and not have both choices open when in world.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>7</p></td><td><p class='title'>Lost Vision: Federated Computing</p><p class='details'>I remember that one of the things that first drew me into High Fidelity was a vision that Philip Rosedale had as far back as 2013. Here's a quote from a Silicon Valley VR Meetup from July of 2013:

"And then the second thing. as I said, is to somehow build a system in which perhaps the majority or all of the servers aside from simply being decentralized or distributed are actually running on machines at home and using idle resources because Second life has, I said 40,000 cores and typically about 100,000 online. So you've got less machines than you do people. That are being serviced by those machines, basically. What if we could use your extra machines while you were asleep? If you do the math on that I think you could have ten times as many machines as as people. So its something like it could be as much as a two order magnitude of change in the amount of machine power that we have."</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>9</p></td><td><p class='title'>Make the Oven its own download</p><p class='details'>Right now, the only way to get the oven tools is to download the client and server. This is great if you want to run a server, but useless if you JUST want the oven and nothing else.

Considering that a zipped version of a freshly made oven is 13.5MB (9.6MB if you use 7z), this would open the doorway to allowing artists who have dedicated workstations to grab the tools needed for their 3D work without having to download extra stuff.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>3</p></td><td><p class='title'>Option for VCPkg to not build debug packages</p><p class='details'>The required size for using VCPkg is becoming very large and slow when it has to build newer versions. A major culprit is the building of debug versions. If the intent of building is just for a release, then an option to skip the debug builds should be a thing to speed up the process and not waste so much space.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>6</p></td><td><p class='title'>Hide volume meter while mute is enabled</p><p class='details'>As of release 0.82.0 the volume meter is visible even if your mic is muted.

As a result, they're not active.

So... can we just have this enabled?

Why isn't there simply a browse option?

Alternatively, I have to upload it to the marketplace and set the item NOT FOR SALE, which is basically quite weird anyway. Not intuitive at all. That is one of the biggest issues facing HiFi - the lack of intuitiveness.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>8</p></td><td><p class='title'>Offer the Avatar Mixer to proxy FST URLs for added avatar security</p><p class='details'>At this time, FSTs are directly hosted and accessed from a web source, and the information about the hosted location is sent out to everyone under the AvatarData property skeletonModelURL.

This feature request is an option to allow the Avatar Mixer to become a temporary host for the requested FST, acting as a proxy to the real FST. This would allow users to still get the information they need while also blocking the direct URL of where the FST is stored (preventing direct avatar copying). This can also help users who may have a stronger connection to the server rather than the host spot of the avatar.

In addition, this can also act as a better way of enforcing avatar whitelists or blocking uncertified avatars, as the FST information can be filtered in advance.

The basic process would be as follows:
1.	User joins a domain and sends the avatar mixer their skeletonModelURL (MyAvatar).
2.	Avatar mixer downloads and stores the FST in cache.
3.	The FST url given to other users is based on the FST in cache (avatar:///{SESSION-ID}.fst).
4.	Other users process FST as usual (grab FBX, textures, etc).

An obvious challenge is having the avatar mixer check the FST and add any missing information (ie: resolving local urls to global urls), but since the assignment-client should have access to the same parser interface does, this shouldn’t be too complicated.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>2</p></td><td><p class='title'>Custom Android Avatars</p><p class='details'>Can we use our low poly models for the android version of HiFi? Maybe have a file where we can link our avatar.fst. Woody is getting old and I have never liked the other models. Thanks</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>3</p></td><td><p class='title'>Interpolate frames on animated entities.</p><p class='details'>Case example. Another user and I have built a test ferris wheel that a user can sit on and ride (attaching themselves to the bone). It's animation cycle is currently set to 60fps, however if we want to slow the ride down and bring it to a halt, the frame rate visibly drops as the animation slows down (as expected).  Some sort of frame iterpolation could create a much more pleasant and immersive experience.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>5</p></td><td><p class='title'>Per avatar HMD allignment</p><p class='details'>In the Avatar setting menu there is an option to select either 'Head' or 'Eyes' for HMD alignment.
I suggest a third option 'Default' that reads the setting from the FST file so that it is a per avatar setting rather than a user setting but still letting the user override the default.
It just makes more sense since witch option works best is solely dependent on the avatar</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>4</p></td><td><p class='title'>Add compression to KTX textures (baking/oven related)</p><p class='details'>Currently, the current KTX tools do not offer any kind of deflation of texture files, resulting in increased bandwidth costs when on slower networks. The Kronos format is capable of deflating the textures and could result in possible 50% reductions in file sizes without loss to quality, further benefiting the use of baking objects and avatars.

While Basis/Crunch is not available, zlib and ANS compression on image textures are completed.

Not using MSAA should be an immediate fail for any app submission" ... "In general, using MSAA means you can't use a deferred rendering engine. You don't want to for performance reasons, anyway."

One of the common criticisms of High Fidelity is how blurry it is, and switching to forward rendering is the solution so that MSAA can be used. I know a forward renderer is already in the works for mobile, but I think it needs to be default on both mobile and desktop for performance and quality reasons. The benefits of deferred are outweighed by the problems it causes in VR.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>2</p></td><td><p class='title'>Add "invert selection" shortcut to Entity List</p><p class='details'>I recommend "Ctrl I" as binding. This can be quite useful.  For example, when cleaning up a domain I discovered 100s of items scattered throughout the far corns of the domain.  In order to do so, I set a low radius the included my primary build, selected all the items on the list, then increased the radius and refreshed the list. All the important items are still selected and I can now see on the accidental objects. If I had an invert option, I could simply press this, followed by "delete" to remove all the extra entities, preserving the intended ones.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>7</p></td><td><p class='title'>Create Menu: combine cube & sphere into one category, Primitives.</p><p class='details'>Both options technically open the same menu, but select a different shape at the top of the Properties tab.  I've noticed a number of users see these two options and don't realize there are various types of primitive shapes available.  If the button was just called primitives they would intuitively understand that other shapes are available.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>6</p></td><td><p class='title'>Edit marketplace items without deleting them</p><p class='details'>Currently the only way to update a marketplace item is to delete it and re upload it.
Can we please have an easier way to edit and update marketplace items.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>2</p></td><td><p class='title'>Android 9 support on Google Play</p><p class='details'>I have been fighting with getting the game to work on my new Samsung s10+, but the only place I can download it is on the dev page and every world I tried to join says I have the wrong protocol version.
The Dev version says 10273 (as of this post)
The google play version is 0.81.1</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>1</p></td><td><p class='title'>Create new Lock Types: Server Modifiable Lock and Self Modifiable Lock</p><p class='details'>Right now, we only have two lock properties: on and off. When active, the properties of an entity cannot be modified until someone (or something) with lock/unlock permissions unlocks the object. If a server script is trying to modify an object, it must first unlock it, then perform the modifications, in addition to re-establishing the lock.

This feature request is to add a third and forth state: server locked, which means that any edit requests from a client/interface are ignored and only the server's edits are acknowledged (except for the state itself, where a user does have permission to enable/disable this) and self modifiable lock, meaning that only edits from scripts included on the object  or the owner of the object are acknowledged.

The basic idea behind these two states are to moderate what edits are performed so there are no windows for tampering. This would allow a user to lock down a wall clock, for example, but the wall clock can still operate without having to unlock itself every time, as edits from users are denied, except for those with the special unlock/lock permissions. Likewise, objects that are designed to be interactable by the owner and the owner only don't have to run checks if someone or something else modified it unless someone again has special permissions.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>4</p></td><td><p class='title'>Templates for "Export Entities"</p><p class='details'>At the moment, the "Export Entity" and "Export Selection" will make a generic json file. However, some assumptions can be made depending on your intentions. For example, if you are exporting a wearable, you might want it to automatically use jointIndexName instead of jointIndexNumber which will use the name of the bone the wearable is attached to rather than a number, which can be different on all avatars.  This will also create further compatibility between avatars with wearables. Hats for example. Most avatars will have a bone simply called "head."  Using the command mentioned above in the auto-generated json will ensure the hat attaches to head. This could also be another place to set parameters such as grabbable, collisions, etc, as you cannot reach the create menu without domain permissions.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>1</p></td><td><p class='title'>crash only on bingo</p><p class='details'>i tryed on developer menu to change on render than scale resolution  al tryed them and stil i crash on bingo place only there</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>11</p></td><td><p class='title'>Buy HFC Much Easier</p><p class='details'>Make it MUCH more easier to buy HFC. I have come across a number of users who want to buy HFC. High fidelity has been showing signs of needing money. A smart move would be to make it much much more easier to buy coins. Allow users to buy coins directly from the web site. The main page on the site doesn't even have a link to direct you to buying coins.Maybe under market, add a buy hifi coins.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>15</p></td><td><p class='title'>Allow Multiple UV maps per model</p><p class='details'>Models and materials defined in the models should be able to use all the UV Maps defined in the model file.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>6</p></td><td><p class='title'>The ability to cam around your avatar while in the wearable menu</p><p class='details'>At the moment the camera is locked, making it difficult to adjust wearables (no side view).

Placing a field on the login screen for setting this would probably make this aspect a lot more understandable.

Let say I want to create an event and I want to invite some people to attend. I have their emails, and I send the invitations. Because I don't know their HiFi usernames, or they don't have one yet, it is impossible to create the access policy.

This can be neat and reintroduce the neat idea that was demoed in AvatarIsland, but is also asking for trouble, adds a new form of greifing, and just makes the following bug worse: http://roadmap.highfidelity.com/bugs/p/wearables-can-get-moved-by-grabbing

So let's add a fresh, new grab property: grabbableByOthers! This property acts a bit like the collisionMask property, "Other avatars", where we can decide if other users can grab a particular avatar entity. That way, if someone doesn't want their sunglasses moved 100m away, they can be locked down enough that they can still flick them up from time to time.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>3</p></td><td><p class='title'>User rendering priority for events</p><p class='details'>At the Multi-con event, I had hard time to see the 3 Mythbusters rendered in the same time, including a part of the crowd present there.
The algo to manage the load is clearly not working well for such event where there are people giving a show on a stage. An admin should be able to specify some users with rendering priority, to at least allow people to see those who are on the stage.

Avatar theft is too easy, and it doesn't get punished.

I know avatars can easily be stolen via script. I don't know how it works, but I've seen it happen. Many users have had it happen to them. Maybe a more technical user could elaborate in the comments. I uploaded and submitted my avatar through the marketplace, I got it verified, I got myself a certificate. Why did I bother going through all of that?

Also, the rules are not strict enough on avatar theft. The greeters could not ban the person who was proven to have been stealing them (Not attacking the greeters, I know they're just following the rules). It should be clearly against the terms of service to steal someones avatar without their permission.

I'm not a good programmer, I don't know how to fix this. But the other platforms seem to do avatar protection better than Hifi does, so I know that more could be done. This hurts creators, and it hurts High Fidelity when creators don't want to use a platform that can't give their work reasonable protections.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>2</p></td><td><p class='title'>A straight plug in in MakeHuman to save out a HiFi formatted av</p><p class='details'>Is it possible to have a pluggin for MakeHuman standalone that would save out a HiFi av?

You can hear this problem most noticeably by going to a WebPanel streaming audio not hearing anything, only hearing it when opening up the Dash.

parroted by me a few times already in various meetings over the years.

But keeps falling "down the cracks" over these years of community meetings, posts on forums,
So, Parroting again.

I have usually brought up this same exploit many times, and demonstrated it MANY TIMES.
Be it through foxbombs, targeted foxlasers, wallet opening panics, wanted posters, among other mischievous pranks to raise awareness.

But as High Fidelity has grown; 
which has caused the exploits are getting serious, or damaging; which can be damning as more and more money is getting involved.

I am afraid of just nodding at the direction "The exploit you described" is just waiting for murphys law to kick in:

So, I'll open the can of worms.

I mean the can was already open, It actually starting to reek,
but I am turning it upside down and laying its contents on a plate with a solution how to address it.
 There are already protections in place for most HiFi run domains (Except, Maker), which is why this is ok time to talk about it in more depth.

....

Most attack vectors for "Exploits" as discussed in the town meeting on 14 March 19 involve running an
entity script that targets a specific users (this is fairly simple to do). 
It's not even an exploit, it is the main feature, which can, and has been exploited.

Lets describe the crux of it:

You can edit ANY UNLOCKED ENTITY. There is no such thing as "edit permission". You can do this with a client script or a modified create script.

The nature of Hifi requires interactable objects to be unlocked, so you cant really lock everything. 
If things were locked, theyd be static. You cant do anything with a locked entity, except unlock it, if you have the permission to do so. So LOCKED Entities do have domain level protection which is a good thing.

However, for unlocked entities, this means you can apply any entity script to any unlocked object; unless the server denies you this through filters.

Entity scripts are scripts that run locally on your client and allows it impact you, or command you to impact the world. So if you fire a flare gun up in the sky? You create the entity, simulate it, and definite the particle and light effects for other clients. Hook guns? it applies an force to your avatar, pushing it forward along the hookline.

This is how many things in High Fidelity works. You have an input and have an output. Make sense right? Flow.js is a fantastic example of a client script that animates your avatar depending on the your avatar and other avatars.

Combined with Message Queue, you can do... many great things... and many unspeakable things with this.
Such as take over control of another user's actions. 
And if targeted to a specific user you can be them, at least according to the server.

All things great power comes with great responsibility; and with everyone having such power, you shouldn't just trust everyone.

....

Scripts are the lifeblood of High Fidelity, without them we have the fun things, they sorta need to have the unferreted access;
Permissions systems like SL or Android would be nice to have, but have architectural challenges ahead and may take years to establish, 
which does not address the short-term (even if alphas been discussing this longer than a few years).

Most of this can be protected against via Entity Filters, and fairly all High Fidelity domains are protected by them,
meaning places like Spot and Bank are fairly secure, (i will keep poking ;) ).
These tend to work by only allowing certain edits (like position, rotation) to be trasmitted to other users, with everything else being "locked".

But Filters are an arcane art and not well documented for others to make full use of.

They are also not provided by default in the sandboxes provided to users.

----

So.. If youd eliminate the client from running a malicious script, 
then youd eliminate this attack vector: 

It is a Matter of Trust. 
Thus we need to be able to define that trust through Client Script Whitelists.

The white list should also be extendable by user, allowing one to add their own scripts to the list. But this should only affect that user.

By Default, what everyone should have theirs running at.
You should Only trust following scripts:

1. Released (Stressing REVIEWED) marketplace scripts. (Marketplace Authorized)
2. Scripts or url domains that the domain say are ok. (Domain Authorized, or Required)
3. Scripts from file system. (Local filesystem)

Users should be able to turn on / off which ever. If a domain requires scripts to run on the domain, they should be allowed to run on client. If client denies these from running then client should immediately disconnect and give a message to user that the domain requires the permission to connect. (This allows for gamelogic, and I think is already in place)

This can later be expanded upon with a permission system that analyses what commands the script will run; and if permissions are given, will allow it to be placed on the whitelist. Ofcourse there are some stuff that should never be allowed to go through such, such as presence of eval.


This does not eliminate bad actor domains, but it would put more control for the client. 
IT would also put more people in ease of not bumping into entities that may do something naughty with their clients.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>13</p></td><td><p class='title'>ability to move camera independently of avatar</p><p class='details'>This would be particularly useful when building wearable attachment points for marketplace items.

This adds the properties itemName, itemDescription, itemCategories, itemArtist,  itemLicense, limitedRun, editionNumber, entityInstanceNumber, marketplaceID, certificateID, and staticCertificateVersion. These properties all involve the marketplace certification system to help prove authenticity and help avoid copying in normal use cases (ignoring URL acquisition and what not).

What I propose is having a similar set of conditions to be passed to the avatar class (Avatar/MyAvatar). This could then be coupled into the avatar mixer, where if a certified marketplace avatar is worn, only the owner can wear it. If a user copies the skeletonURL to themselves, the avatar mixer could deny its use, either by showing a woodie avatar (in T-Pose to avoid joint index differences) and/or other action (informing the client the URL is invalid).

In addition, this would help pave the way for "Make Avatar Certificates readable" (http://roadmap.highfidelity.com/feature-requests/p/make-avatar-certificates-readable) while beginning to put the initial steps towards avatar security, as at this time, nothing stops a user from wearing a certified avatar they don't own.

This could have other appliances too like having a region where music plays. The attenuation from that region to the current one can still be arbitrary (like 0 for live music), but give the users the ability to control the volume.

You then have to enter this coupon on the website to purchase the place name outside of VR.

I tried this yesterday and hit on a couple of snags:

-	First, I learned the Oculus client does not implement the tablet UI in the Inventory app to conduct HFC transfers (I filed this as a bug). 

-	Then, it was an awkward experience between the banker and I for him to give me the coupon code. I asked if there was a way for him to e-mail it to me and he said that wasn’t something available to him. So instead he wrote it on a text box and held up a sign with the code. I took a snapshot of it and saved it to my desktop. Of course, as an image this means I can’t just copy/paste it into the website.

-	Outside of VR, I then went to use the coupon code and the system informed me the coupon code was invalid. Now, the banker had just assured me he had a fresh batch of coupons but I didn’t think anything of it at the time. I contacted support and provided screenshots of the coupon code provided in-world and the error shown on the website when using the same code. They responded quickly with a new coupon code which worked. The support rep mentioned that the banker may have some stale coupons.

Suggestions:
I do like the personal touch of meeting with a banker in a nice environment. It gives the transaction a tangible feeling. I’d be great if the banker could easily fire off an e-mail with the coupon code for easy copy/pasting.

As an alternative, it’d be even more convenient if in the tablet UI where there is already an option to purchase a coupon with HFC would allow the purchase of a place name coupon. I asked the banker if this was an option and he informed me the coupon systems are different. Allowing the purchase from the tablet would avoid the need to set up a time to meet with the banker if it’s hard to find a good time that works.

Lastly, another option would be to have place name coupons available for purchase in the marketplace. This would make the process familiar to those who have already purchased from the marketplace or make it a great introduction to doing so.

Another enhancement to the above suggestions would be if upon purchase the system would recognize the coupon in the user’s inventory and allow it to be applied at purchase time automatically without having to enter the code. 

Furthermore, the next level would be allowing the user to choose the place name upon purchase in-world, allowing one to conduct the entire transaction without having to take off the VR headset.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>2</p></td><td><p class='title'>User Interface 'layer'</p><p class='details'>I just got a headset and twice got "griefed" by people standing so close to me that their body obscured the tablet so I had to move and in one case drop back to desktop to GOTO a different domain.

It should use the original origin point stored in the FBX/OBJ/GLTF file.

This is abnormal behavior not found in literally any other game engines, and it adds an enormous level of frustration. 

If someone creates a large, highly detailed city in Blender with everything placed where it's supposed to be (all at the same origin, 0,0,0), they should be able to import all of that and KEEP it at that location once it's in High Fidelity. But that currently doesn't happen - instead, we're forced to re-position everything all over again, because the origin points of models are completely different once in High Fidelity.

High Fidelity should behave more like Unreal, Unity, etc. in this aspect. It should respect the origin point stored in our model files (fbx, gltf, obj), not change it without even asking us if that's we want.

You could even add a toggle switch in the model entity properties to keep the old behavior, if for some strange reason that's what you actually want. The vast majority of 3D artists will tell you they don't.  They'd rather position everything in their favorite 3D editor that they're already used to.

This will allow creation of scripts to respond to music which will open up all kinds of creative possibilities.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>3</p></td><td><p class='title'>Add support for LIV or other mixed reality recording software</p><p class='details'>So that users can easily record mixed reality videos demonstrating High Fidelity in action.

Speeds would be identical so you could have a person flying in the air, moving on the ground, and traveling in a vehicle and if they all have speeds set to 'slow' they are all traveling at the exact same speed. Easier to move in groups this way, especially for 2 people wanting to fly through a domain to explore it together.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>5</p></td><td><p class='title'>Vendor API</p><p class='details'>An API would be beneficial for outside vendors to participate in the blockchain, use HiFi currency and support oAuth or some mechanism for authenticating users.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>6</p></td><td><p class='title'>Ability to manually configure the noisegate</p><p class='details'>This should be up to the user to manually specify a noise-gate threshold.

Such cases are possibly to edge cases. 
For this reason, it would be good on the stand alone Oven executable to have an option to keep only the texture processing and keep the armature untouched.
This way, we could at least continue to used the advantages of the texture compression those models.</p></td></table></div><div class='post'><table><td><p class='score'>4</p></td><td><p class='title'>Parented objects don't follow children</p><p class='details'>Right now, child object follow the parent, but not the other way around.
